    """
    routine for calculating the information needed for setting up
    a piecewise linear relaxation on a subbox of the objective
    function, i.e., we need to compute an underestimator and
    therefore the overestimation error

    Parameters
    ----------
    o : pyomo objective object
        representing the objective for which the information should
        be calculated.
    vars : list
        containing pyomo variable objects appearing in the objective
        function of interest.
    info : dict
        containing all information of the current box of interest.
    call_model : function
        returning a pyomo model of the problem to be solved.

    Returns
    -------
    info : dict
        containing all information to set up a piecewise linear relaxation
        on the current box of interest.
